### Before
I’m currently pursuing an MPhil in Biotechnology at the University of Cambridge, focusing on the intersection of AI and biology. Specifically, I am looking at single-cell foundation models and using them for drug discovery. I am part of MARS (Mentorship for Alignment Research Students) where we are investigating using Gradient Routing for circuit transplantation in transformer models. On top of this, I am a committee member of the Cambridge AI Safety Hub (CAISH). I am also currently a baby VC fellow.

### Before before
I previously completed my BSc in Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. My dissertation focused on convolutional Gaussian Processes, which are a beautiful method for using Gaussian Processes for images (or even any graph-structured data). During my time in Edinburgh, I interned at Opteran as research engineer, and Wood Mackenzie on the product team. In my 3rd year, I went to Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. This was a wonderful experience which not only made me 10x more motivated and aspirational, but also inspired a lot of my thoughts around the UK and how to make it better. During my time at undergrad, I played football for the university.

### Much Before before
I grew up in Sheffield, a city in the North of England (also the best city in the world). As a teen, I went on Countdown and won 4 games, finishing 9th in Series 78.
